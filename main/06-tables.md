# Tables in markdown (extended)

Tables can be made using pipes and dashes, and the first row when divided by dashes, then it will be the header of the table.

In tables is possible to define the alignment of the column using the colons on any cell of the table. If theres only one colon at left, all the alignment it will be to the left. If is to the right, the alignment will be to the right. If it has on both sides, the alignment will be to the middle.

| Left   | Middle |  Right |
| :----- | :----: | -----: |
| Text 1 | Text 2 | Text 3 |
| Text 4 | Text 5 | Text 6 |
