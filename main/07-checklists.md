# Checklist in markdown

You can make a checklist by making an unordered list with square brackets with an space in between. Like this: `- [ ]`

If you wanna check the checkbox, you can just put a "x", doesn't matter if is capital or not.

- [x] Made it through the course.
- [x] Started using `markdown`.
- [ ] Finished the `README.md`.
