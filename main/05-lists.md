# Lists in markdown

You can make lists in markdown using dashes, asteriscs or plus sign, and can be unordered or ordered lists (using dots).

- Apple
- Banana
- Melon

1. Apple
2. Banana
3. Melon

The ordered list doesn't need to have the numbers in placed correctly to be ordered correctly.

1. Apple (1ยบ)
1. Banana (1ยบ)
1. Melon (1ยบ)

Those lists can be nested using tab (4 size) or four spaces.

    - Green
    - Red
- Banana

    1. Red
    2. Green
2. Banana
