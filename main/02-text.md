# Formatting text

You can **bold** a text using double **asteriscs** or double __underlines__.

You can do _italics_ just using one of these symbols. You can use single *asterics* or single _underlines_.

You can combine both of these propertys adding more symbols: **_"Just like this."_**

You can get your text ~~crossed off~~. By just putting two tildes on both sides of the word.

Some versions of markdown can <mark>highlight</mark> texts using double equals on both sides, if it doesn't support you can just use the mark tag from HTML.

Other versions of markdown does support the subscript and superscript using "~" and "^", repectively. But using the sub and sup tags like in this example: 
  - X<sup>2</sup>
  - H<sub>2</sub>O
